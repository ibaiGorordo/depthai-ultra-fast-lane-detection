# depthai-ultra-fast-lane-detection
 Lane detection example using the ultra fast lane detection model using the depthai framework.

# Work in progress
The script still does not detect the lanes correctly, so the script needs to still be corrected.

# Inference model
The original model was converted to different formats by [PINTO0309](https://github.com/PINTO0309), download the models from [his repository](https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo/tree/main/140_Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection) and save it into the **[models](https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/depthai-ultra-fast-lane-detection/tree/main/models)** folder.
